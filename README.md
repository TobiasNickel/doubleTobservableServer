doubleTobservableServer
=======================

the doubleTobservableServer, is an expressJS app, with added socket.io. there is also added a little share-mechanism, that broadcasts manipilation on the data to all clients.

With that setup, it is possible to write networking apps, only by writing Clientside-Javascript as demonstated in chat.html and circles.html.

If you want to try out, you should know the basics of tObservableJS and then you can look at the code in chat.html to see the an example app. 


During the week, I will add some more documentation with further instructions.
